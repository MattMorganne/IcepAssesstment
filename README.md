## Description

This project consists of two main components: the TutwokBridge folder and the Ejb folder.

The TutwokBridge folder contains the code for the actual website, implemented using HTML and JSP (JavaServer Pages). This part of the project serves as the user interface and handles the presentation layer.

On the other hand, the Ejb folder contains the library that houses the EJB (Enterprise JavaBeans) business methods. These methods are responsible for interacting with the database and handling the business logic of the application.

Please also note that the viseo presenting the project is available on this file directory please read it.
